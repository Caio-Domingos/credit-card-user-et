## Contributing

I really enjoyed making this app, is my first time making any app using the Vue, and I hadn't used it yet one library to manipulate the state (like Redux, or in this case Vuex), and i really liked this experience, is incredible how all data can be access for all component without need pass her between components, i think my code stay more clean and i was able to better separate the data each in its place for future errors that were appearing in the middle of the way, it was much easier to find and correct them.
